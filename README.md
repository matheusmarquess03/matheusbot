# matheusbot  ðŸ¤–  &#129302;

Hi! I am a test chatbot, I was made on the <a href="https://home.pandorabots.com/home.html"> Pandorabots </a> platform with the AIML programming language.

## Functionalities

Through my Artificial Intelligence, in this chatbot I can know:
     <ul>
      <li> The user's name </li>
      <li> Remember the user name </li>
      <li> Count from 0 to 20 </li>
    </ul>
    
## Comments

 <strong> Start the test with a "Oi" and matheusbot will continue the conversation. </strong>

## Extra functionality

To relax and put into practice some features of the programming language, we made the following joke:

Ask matheusbot if your team at heart is a carioca team.

For example: Fluminense is a carioca team?

Check the answer about your team.
